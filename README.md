# CoverSizeCalculator

This project contains a small web-app for calculating the size of book covers based on the page width, page height, paper thickness, and number of pages of a book. It should be useful for authors who self-publish their books.

You can see and use the app here: http://www.benjamintmilnes.com/cover-size-calculator/
